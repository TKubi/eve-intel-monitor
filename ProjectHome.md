# Welcome to EVE Intel Monitor Project #

This tool allows a player of EVE Online to monitor Intel channels and detect important inelegance information.

The features of the tool include:
  * Read multiple EVE Channel log files
  * Configure the refresh rate for reading changes
  * Detecting when new items are written to the log files.
  * Parsing the Intel and trying to detect useful information - i.e. Solar Systems, player names, etc..
  * Configuring multiple keywords to match against.
  * Synthesize Speech - speak important Intel out-loud.

# How It Works #

I know that there is an EVE chat monitor, but this would be a bit different.

Basically the tool will read the Intel channel logs (from EVE Online folder) and try to present useful information to the user.

Future versions of the tool might include custom Intel parsing logic, more and better speech features, and a centralized server that would be able to collect all Intel through the day, and possibly overlay it over the EVE map.
